## Minimal Viable Demo (if time is limited)

If development time is constrained, focus on these core components:

### Priority 1 (Essential)
1. ✅ Supabase schema + auth + seed data
2. ✅ Mobile app displaying pass with QR + color token
3. ✅ Backend endpoints: POST /passes, GET /passes/{id}/qr
4. ✅ Simple validator PWA for QR scanning
5. ✅ Basic Stripe test checkout integration

### Priority 2 (Important)
1. ✅ Pass validation API with color token verification
2. ✅ Validation event logging
3. ✅ Admin dashboard with basic analytics
4. ✅ PWA manifest for offline installation

### Priority 3 (Nice to have)
1. [ ] Offline token sync mechanism
2. [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
3. [ ] Production deployment automation
4. [ ] Comprehensive test suite

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- ✅ API response time < 1s for validation
- ✅ 99.9% uptime for core services
- ✅ Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage for core modules

### Business KPIs
- User adoption rate > 80% for mobile app
- Validation success rate > 95%
- Average transaction processing time < 30s
- Operator integration time < 2 weeks

### Security KPIs
- ✅ All QR payloads cryptographically signed
- ✅ Color token rotation working correctly
- ✅ No unauthorized access to user data
- ✅ Offline validation tokens properly secured

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Offline validation complexity**: Mitigated by starting with online-only and adding offline as enhancement
2. **Stripe integration issues**: Mitigated by using test mode first and comprehensive error handling
3. **Mobile camera QR scanning**: Mitigated by supporting manual input as fallback

### Security Risks
1. **QR payload tampering**: Mitigated by JWT signing and verification
2. **Color token prediction**: Mitigated by HMAC with server secret
3. **Offline token abuse**: Mitigated by short TTL and usage tracking

### Operational Risks
1. **Database performance**: Mitigated by proper indexing and query optimization
2. **Supabase rate limits**: Mitigated by efficient queries and caching strategy
3. **Third-party dependencies**: Mitigated by fallback mechanisms and monitoring
